This project was completed for my Computer Vision class during my junior year.
It utilizes many libraries that pair well with machine learning modules like Tensorflow and Keras.
The goal of this project was to imitate Neural Style Transfer in Python. (As far as I know, it is possible in C++).
The code will read images in jpg/png format and the user is allowed to tweak the settings in order to get a desirable result.
The resulting image will be a merge of the two selected photos' styles and colors.
