This project was created in my A.I. class during my junior year. It utilizes a pre-trained model for human detection and draws a box around a person.
The code will run for images, videos, and even a web camera! As long as the correct paths are detected, this should run without any issues.
You may also run the program through the Command Prompt and parse specific arguments to their respective file paths.
The OpenCV library is the main reason why this program was possible.
